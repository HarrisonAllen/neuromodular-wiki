Here will be a ton of pictures, screenshots, etc. that describe:
* Order of operations
    1. Take note of ports
    2. Plug in blue board
    3. Connect to the new port
    4. Power on a module (wired, wireless)
* Different screenshots of the GUI and what each thing means, with labels
* Power user commands under the logs menu
* The workflow for using a module, loading configs, etc. etc.

Notes:
* Make a note that delta mode does not allow for batching data, aka record slower
