# This is our test subject

Within this test subject, we have multiple subtopics:
* [Test subject 01]({{ "/test_subject/01/" | relative_url }})
* [Test subject 02]({{ "/test_subject/02/" | relative_url }})
* [Test subject 03]({{ "/test_subject/03/" | relative_url }})

Here's a good spot to test different things, like images, organization, etc.
1. I can give a list of instructions
2. And more to do

## And maybe we want another section
In this section I could provide useful links
* Like the [github page](https://github.mit.edu/bioelectronics/neuromodular)
* Or [my email](mailto:harrisonallen555@gmail.com)

*Let's stop there.*

Oh yeah, to run a test, use `bundle exec jekyll serve` in an admin command prompt
