## What you'll need:
* An assembled and configured module
* A battery
* Solder paste/solder
* Soldering iron (DO NOT USE A HEAT GUN)
* Tweezers

There are different power options that you can use:
* Attached battery
* Wired power
* Removable battery

Here, I'm just going to go over how to attach a battery.

## Attaching a small battery

### 1. Pre-solder the battery pads on the module

It's very important to apply as little heat to the battery as possible to avoid causing a fire or making the battery explode.

To start, pre-solder the battery pads on the module with a generous amount of solder. This battery has solder on its leads already, which will help a bit.

### 2. Solder the leads using a soldering iron

Make sure the + and - pads on the module are lined up with the positive and negative leads on the battery.

You'll want to touch the battery leads with the soldering iron for as little time as possible.

Keep the leads towards the edge of the board so that there's enough space to bend it over the board.

### 3. Carefully bend the battery over the top of the board

You don't want to break the leads, so be careful with this step!

### 4. (Optional) Add epoxy or hot glue to secure the battery leads

The battery leads are pretty fragile, so using something like epoxy to secure the leads isn't a bad idea. You may not be able to reconfigure the module if you do this, though, since it may be impossible to remove the battery without removing other components.

You'll want to touch the battery leads with the soldering iron for as little time as possible.

Keep the leads towards the edge of the board so that there's enough space to bend it over the board. Additionally, check the alignment of the battery so that it doesn't cover up the power header on the top side when you fold it over.

For the large battery, you'll want to make sure some solder is on top of the leads as well.
